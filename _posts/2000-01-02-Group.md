Dr. Suprem R. Das received his PhD degree in Physics from Purdue University in 2013. His thesis work focused on low bandgap, high mobility nanoscale devices such as nanoscale transistors. In 2014, he was a postdoctoral researcher with School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University working on development of novel spintronic devices for spin logic applications using materials exhibiting ‘Giant Spin Hall Effect (GSHE)’. His current research at Iowa state is development of novel 2D semiconductor Devices for Biosensing and Energy harvesting.

</div>

Shaowei is from Zhengzhou,China, and she received her BS of Biological Systems Engineering in  May, 2013 at Iowa State University. Shaowei is getting her MS of Ag &Biosystems Engineering in  May, 2015, while she has started to pursue her PHD degree of ME from Spring, 2015. She has been working on disease diagnosis using Raman Spectrascopy for her MS degree. Since spectra collection requires large quantity to reach a high accuracy, she has focused her interests in learning statistics. For her PHD degree, she is interested in projects related to electrochemical biosensing.

Bolin is from Nanjing, China. He is going to complete his BSME at Iowa State University and continue pursuing MSME related to inkjet printing biosensor and thermoelectric generator topic.
He also acts as a vice president at CSSA, a university organization that helps Chinese students and scholars faster settle down in Ames. He enjoys exploring wild natures and playing basketball on his free time.

####Anne Leners
Anne Leners is from Bettendorf, Iowa and is a sophomore in mechanical engineering and is also pursuing a Spanish minor. Anne enjoys all the aspects of working in the lab. In her free time she enjoys participating in intramurals with friends, rock climbing and running. She hopes to continue her education and pursue a master’s degree after graduation in May 2017. 

####Andrew Nilles
Andrew is a freshman in Mechanical Engineering who hails from the northwest corner of Iowa. His current activities on campus include the clubs/organizations of Emerging Leaders in Engineering, ISU AfterDark, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Long term goals of Andrew’s range from vehicle manufacturing and operation to automation and mechatronics. Andrew is open to any opportunity given, and looks forward to the next four years.

####Jacob Davis

Jacob Davis is from Johnston, Iowa, and is a junior working towards his BSME at ISU.  Jacob is helping to create an instructional video on how to use all of the equipment in the lab. He also aids in the creation and testing of printed graphene circuits.  Jacob plans to work in industry doing some form of testing and analysis or R&D after graduating in 2016.  In his free time Jacob enjoys exploring the countryside on his motorcycle, skiing, working on his car and motorcycle, and hanging out with friends.

####Eric Mootz

Eric is fortunate enough to call the wonderful lakeside city of Neenah, Wisconsin home; however, his father’s career goals gave him and his family the opportunity to live in places such as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Kentucky. Luckily, he refrained from developing a southern accent. In May of 2015 he will be graduating with a Mechanical Engineering degree from Iowa State University. His academic interests are very broad, but he enjoys topics that deal with energy systems and manufacturing. He remains active through his participation in professional organizations including the ASHRAE Student Chapter and ASME, as well as competing for Iowa State's Club Golf Team. Outside of these activities you’ll find Eric maintaining his health at the gym, obliterating ‘peasants’ on his custom gaming PC, or simply enjoying the weekend with his friends. 

####Granit Vokshi
Granit Vokshi is from Kosovo, Europe. He is a junior working towards his Mechanical Engineering degree. After finishing high school he moved to United States where he first went to Muscatine Community College. After receiving his Associates in Science degree he transferred to  Iowa State University. At Iowa State University he is part of Pi Tau Sigma honor society in which his responsibilities are to organise interactive social events between the Mechanical Engineering Professors and Students. His career interests consist of working with R&D departments or energy system analysis.
